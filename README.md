# ðŸ”— Shortly

One of my first projects! I did this little app in 2021 and since then I have learned a lot... The inspiration came from [here](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/url-shortening-api-landing-page-2ce3ob-G) and it was a lot of fun making this fully responsive, coding pixel perfect to the original desing and doing my first API data fetching.
